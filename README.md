# Salutation

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to create an open-sourced program for use in healthcare facilities to reduce medial errors through absolute patient identification. Salutation will combine facial, voice and fingerprint recognition to identify patients. 

Built with: Salutation is built with Python 3 along with the following libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, SKimage, Scipy, and Sklearn. Additionally, we will be using Synfinger to test for fingerprinting due to the lack of proper fingerprinting equipment.
